# Useless OS
An Os That Says Hello World

# Note
you can change the message by changing "message: db 'Hello World', 0" Hello World to what ever you wanna say (line 26)

# Install
requirments: nasm, qemu, git. If your on windows replace the build.sh file with build.cmd (I think). Idk about Mac

```
git clone https://github.com/companioncubegd/mini-projects
cd mini-projects/Useless-OS
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

Your Done! (The OS is started in the build.sh)
